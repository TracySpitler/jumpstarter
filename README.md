## Live Deployment with Heroku

Set up a MongoDB database or use a service like [mLab](https://mlab.com/)

Log in or sign up with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

Create an app for the both the staging (release) and master branches. (_You can create a [pipeline](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/pipelines) for auto deployment_)

Under the ```Settings``` tab, set the necessary config vars:
```
MONGO_HOST
MONGO_DATABASE
SECRET
```

*__Using mLab:__*

The Mongo URI will look like this: mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds151814.mlab.com:51814/shopalot

_Examples:_

* ```MONGO_HOST``` would equal ```<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds151814.mlab.com:51814```
* ``` MONGO_DATABASE``` would equal ```blockbuster```
* ```SECRET``` needs to be a secure and randomized string.

Under the ```Deploy``` tab, connect to GitHub and set and up the respective branch deployment.

For the initial deployment, you can push a change to your staging (release) or master branch, or manually deploy a branch on Heroku.

__Your app should now be up and running on Heroku__
